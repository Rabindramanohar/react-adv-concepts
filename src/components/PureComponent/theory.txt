Problem: React Components render method re-render Component even if we pass same prop and state.
         So app perfomance slightly decrease.

Solution: React.PureComponent is same subclass like React.Components but it is only render component when there
          is a difference between current and previous states and props.

Syntax: class Example extends React.PureComponent {
    render() {
        return(
            <h1>Hello {this.props.name}</h1>
        )
    }
}


Note: Remember that React.PureComponent only do the shallow comparision the objects. If your states or props 
      contains complex data structure, it may produce false-negative for deeper difference.

Shallow Compare: 
    It performs shallow equallity (===) check on the current  props  and the next props objects as well as 
    current state and next state objects.

    It does this by iterating on the keys  of the objects being compared and returnint true when the value  of
    a key in each object are not strictly equal.

    Shallow compare works by checking if two values are equal in case of primitive type like string, number and 
    in case of objects it just check the reference. So if you shallow compare a deep nested object it will just
    check the reference not the values inside that object.  

When to use PureComponent: Only use PureComponent when you expect to have simple props and states.
