                                                HOC
Problem: Sometimes we have to write same logic in many components, also in fetching data we have to fetch in
         each components if you don't pass props.      

Solution: A Higher Order Component(HOC) is a advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. HOC 
          is a function that takes a component and returns a new component.

Syntax: HOCs are not part of the React API. They are pattern that emerges from React's compositional nature.

    const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent);

    where, higherOrderComponent is HOC comoponent that add some additional functionality to original component
    which is WrappedComponent and returns an enhanced WrappedComponent.

                                        HOC in simple terms
1. It is a Component
2. Which takes two agrugments, first is component and 2nd is data.
3. Then it return a new Component.
4. The return comoponent is enhanced version of comoponent that we have passed.    



                                    HOC Use Cases

1. Loading Screen until component fetches data.
2. In Styling component.
3. Providing specific data or props to component etc..

Notes:
1. Avoid using HOC inside render method
2. Static method must be copied over
3. Refs Aren't Passed Through
