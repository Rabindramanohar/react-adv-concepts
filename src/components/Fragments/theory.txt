Problem: If we use simple div tag in return, and wrap all other tags inside that div. Then this div adds an
         single extra node to our react tree.

Solution: To resolve this issue React gives React.Fragment which will not react unnecessary div node in the dom
          React.Fragment take one argument "key" which help React to iterate over the array of element. React 
          will keep track of whether the element is add, removed or modified.
