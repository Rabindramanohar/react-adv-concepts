Problem: Access child component from parent component without re-rendering and passing props and states.

Solution: Ref forwarding is a technique for automatically passing a ref through a component to one of its 
          child. This is typically not necessary for most components in the application. However, it can be
          useful for some kinds of components, especially in resuable component libraries.

Sytax: 

    Create Ref using React.createRef:
    constructor(props) {
        super(props);
        this.myRef = React.createRef()
    }

    Forward Ref:
    const RefChildDemo = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => 
    (<button ref = {ref}>Click</button>));
