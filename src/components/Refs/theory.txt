Problem: Reference a DOM element without re-rendering the whole component, and without using the props and states

Solution: Ref provides a way to access the DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method.

Syntax:
        Create Ref using React.createRef():

        constructor(props) {
            super(props);
            this.myRef = React.createRef();
        }

        Accessing Ref:

        render() {
            return<div ref={this.myRef} />
        }

                            WHEN TO USE Refs
1. Managing focus, text selection, or media playback.
2. Triggering imperative animation.
3. Integratingn with 3rd party DOM libraries.
