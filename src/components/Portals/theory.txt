Problem: When we want to render component which may be completely separate from the original component, such 
         as tooltips, modal etc... Its break the UI or parent div.

Solution: Portals provides a good way to render children into a DOM node that exits outside the DOM hierarchy
          of the parent component still it can use all the functionality of main DOM.

Syntax: 
        render() {
            return ReactDOM.createPortal(

                child,                    // First agrument Child represents any renderable React child such 
                                          // as element. String or Fragment.


                container                 // The second agrument container is a DOM element such as div.
            )
        }
